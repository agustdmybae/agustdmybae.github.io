                <h4>June 2023</h4>
                <p>
                    A chatbot for NCCU students to access mental health counseling information. <br>
                    I implemented ChatGPT API for generating conversational content and leveraged Dialogflow for analyzing user input. 
                    It supports features including depression self test and providing counseling services information. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Care NCCU aims to provide a reliable mental health information channel to assist in addressing the 69% increase in counseling demand among NCCU students over the past three years.

               <h4>May 2023</h4>
               <p>
                Noisserpmi is my work for the NCCU DCT 14th graduation exhibition.<br> 
                The work consists of four interactive artworks.<br>  
                <br> 
                I developed interactive web pages by p5.js, HTML/CSS, Express, Socket.IO<br> 
                I also implemented various Arduino sensors to collect data to trigger interactive elements on web pages using Johnny-Five library.<br> 
                <br> 
                (Secret: Noisserpmi is the opposite of Impression)<br>

                <h4>Dec. 2022</h4>
                <p>
                    I led my team to develop a helper system for monitoring washing machine availability in university dormitory.
                    We implemented buttons and reed switches to track the status of washing machines, and also
                    developed a Node.js-based website integrated with the sensor module using Johnny-Five library.<br>
                    <br>
                    We implemented our prototype system in one of the NCCU dormitory and succesully improved the issue of laundry rush.<br>

               <p>
                    Developed a local version control system with Java as part of data structure course in UC Berkeley.
                    Implemented essential features of Git, 
                    including staging files, file tracking, and branching file versions

                <h4>Jan. 2022</h4>
                    <p>
                    I collaborated with two members to develop a web-based game to support the algal reef protection referendum in Taiwan.
                    I implemented a Node.js-based website with p5.js for visualization and Socket.IO for multiplayer functionality.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Our game was played by 50 students and we successfully raised environmental awareness among these players by integrating educational elements into the game.
